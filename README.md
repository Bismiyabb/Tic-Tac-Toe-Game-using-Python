# TIC-TAC-TOE Game 

This project is a graphical implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe using Python's Tkinter library.  
It is a two-player game where players take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with "X" and "O".  
The objective is to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row to win the game.  
The game also includes a feature to restart the game.  
## Features:
- Player Turns: The game alternates between two players, "X" and "O". The starting player is chosen randomly at the beginning of each game.
- Win Detection: The game checks for win conditions after each move, highlighting the winning combination in green.
- Tie Detection: The game detects when all spaces are filled without a winner and declares a tie, changing the background color of all buttons to yellow.
- Reset Game: A reset button allows players to start a new game at any time.
- Graphical User Interface: The game board and control buttons are created using Tkinter, providing an intuitive and interactive user experience.
